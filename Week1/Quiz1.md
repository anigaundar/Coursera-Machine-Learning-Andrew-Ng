Question 1
-------
A computer program is said to learm from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some performance measure **P** of its performance on **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experiecne **E**.
Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather dta, and have it learn to predict weather. What wuld be a reasonable chice for **P** ?

* The weather prediction task.
* The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.
* The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather.
* None of these.

Answer: <br/>
True/False | Statement | Explanation 
--- | --- | ---
False|The weather prediction task.| It is Task **T**
False|The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.| It is experience **E**.
True|The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather.| This can be obtained as an effect of **T** using **E**


Question 2 
-------
The amount of rain that falls in a day is usually measured in either millimeters(mm) or inches. Suppose you use a learning algorithm to predict how much rain will fall tomorrow.
Would you treat this as a classification or regression problem?
* Classification
* Regression

Answer<br/>

Answer | Explanation
---|---
**Regression**| Here we are predicting amount of rainfall (based on the past data and weather parameters) so this is a Regression Problem. In classification we classify the data into distinct categories.
